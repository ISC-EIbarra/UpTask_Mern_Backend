/**
 * The `checkAuth` function is a middleware that checks if a valid token is present in the request
 * headers and verifies it using a JWT secret, and then attaches the decoded user information to the
 * request object before passing it to the next middleware.
 * @param req - The `req` parameter is the request object that contains information about the incoming
 * HTTP request, such as headers, body, and query parameters. It is an object that is passed to the
 * middleware function by the Express framework.
 * @param res - The `res` parameter is the response object in Express.js. It is used to send the
 * response back to the client.
 * @param next - The `next` parameter is a callback function that is used to pass control to the next
 * middleware function in the request-response cycle. It is typically called at the end of the current
 * middleware function to indicate that it has completed its processing and the next middleware
 * function should be called.
 * @returns In the code provided, if the token is successfully decoded and the user is found, the
 * function will call the `next()` function, indicating that the authentication check was successful
 * and the request can proceed to the next middleware or route handler.
